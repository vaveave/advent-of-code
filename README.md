# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my small Advent of Code corner! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ® This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, with one Python script for each day of the challenge. The input data for each day is automatically downloaded using a session token, so all you need to do is run the scripts!

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set Up Your Session Token

To download the input data, you'll need to authenticate by setting the `ADVENT_OF_CODE_SESSION_ID` environment variable.

#### For Windows:
```cmd
setx ADVENT_OF_CODE_SESSION_ID "your_session_token_here"
```

#### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
export ADVENT_OF_CODE_SESSION_ID="your_session_token_here"
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment Using `pyproject.toml`

This project uses `pyproject.toml` for managing dependencies and environment setup. To get started, make sure you have **[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)** installed, as it helps manage Python packages and virtual environments.

If you donâ€™t have Poetry installed, you can install it by running:

#### For macOS/Linux/Windows:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Once Poetry is installed, you can create and activate the virtual environment with the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` and create a virtual environment for you.

To activate the virtual environment, run:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### 3. Run the Solution for Any Day

Each day has its own Python script ready to run. Simply use this command to run the solution for a specific day:

```bash
py aoc/2023/1
```

Just replace `2023/1` with the year and day you want to run (e.g., `2023/2` for Day 2 of 2023).

### 4. Happy Coding!

Thatâ€™s it! Now you can enjoy solving the puzzles. ðŸŽ‰ If you want to try a different year or day, just run the corresponding script with `py`.
